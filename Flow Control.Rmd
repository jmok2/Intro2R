```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE)
```

## Flow Control

A lot of programming requires understanding and controlling the flow of code execution. This is important both in top-level scripts as well as in functions. The simplest form of flow is linear - each line in a script is executed once in a sequential, top-down form, like this:

```{r}
a <- 5
b <- 6
c <- a + b
print(c * 3)
```
