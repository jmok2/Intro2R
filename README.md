## Course Description

This course will focus on establishing a solid fundamental understanding of data manipulation and analysis with R. No programming experience is necessary, and all backgrounds are welcome. We will start with an introduction to the R command line, followed by a detailed description of R data structures and how to manipulate them. The course will continue by covering commonly used R functions and students will then learn how to write their own functions and scripts. We will end by exploring visualization in R using base R graphics and the ggplot2 package. For the final project, students will write an R script to analyse their own data as well as edit R scripts from other students.

## Software

Students should come with the latest versions of R and RStudio loaded on their laptops. They can be obtained at:
