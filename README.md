## Course Description

This course will focus on establishing a solid fundamental understanding of data manipulation and analysis with R. No programming experience is necessary, and all backgrounds are welcome. We will start with an introduction to the R command line, followed by a detailed description of R data structures and how to manipulate them. The course will continue by covering commonly used R functions and students will then learn how to write their own functions and scripts. We will end by exploring visualization in R using base R graphics and the ggplot2 package. For the final project, students will write an R script to analyse their own data.  

## Software

Students should come with the latest versions of R and RStudio loaded on their laptops. They can be obtained at:

R: https://www.r-project.org  
RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com

Week 7 (5/16)   practical examples  
Week 10 (6/6)   project review  

## Project

Students who have officially enrolled in the class will be required to submit a function that they have written. The function should serve some useful purpose for your work by doing some sort of data manipulation, analysis, or plotting using techniques learned in the class. Please send the function to me in its own .r script file by the end of the day on Friday, June 2. Try to keep the function less than 100 lines long and comment it well. If running the function requires a special data set, send it as an R object along with a second script file that shows how it is executed. If you can't get the function to work, please send what you have at that point along with comments of what is working and what is not working. You will get full credit for the attempt and documentation. Finally, please let me know if I can (anonymously) use your code in class (working or not) for review on the final day.  
Files should be sent to me compressed in a .zip file named, "Lastname_F_SIO296.zip", where "F" is the first initial (e.g., "Archer_E_SIO296.zip"). Please be sure that the script is self-contained, meaning that it contains all necessary data files in its own folder and I will be able to execute it. It should also not manipulate files or folders in folders other than its own. Finally, please limit the number of external packages it requires and load them at the beginning so I can make sure I have everything necessary installed on my machine.
